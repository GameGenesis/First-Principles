A puzzle game that visualizes the nature of a curve and its corresponding derivative function, and how various rules (e.g. power rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, squeeze theorem, and L'Hôpital's rule) of differentiation can work in a given equation. It further clarifies the relationship between the rules; for example, proving the mechanism behind power rule using the first principles ```lim h->0 (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h```, or explaining the product rule using the power rule. Same goes for the editions that will be released later, which include topics such as definite/indefinite integration and infinite series.

### The game will be released in a total of *four* editions:
1. **Pre-Calculus**: The Nature of Functions
2. **The Fundamentals of Calculus**: Limits and Differentiation
3. **Integral Calculus**: The Most Powerful Humanmade Tool
4. **Infinite Series**: Let's Explore Above and Beyond
